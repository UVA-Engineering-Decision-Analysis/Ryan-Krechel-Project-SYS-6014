# SYS 6014 PROJECT - RYAN KRECHEL

## INTRODUCTION

The goal for this project is to create a seasonal investing model to beat a buy-and-hold investment strategy using Vanguard ETFs. In theory, there are certain market trends that repeat at the same time each year. For instance, the beginning of December tends to be a time when investors sell off stocks to cover the cost of taxes, which generally causes losses in the stock market. If an investor is aware of this trend, he or she should choose to invest in less aggressive accounts (perhaps bonds) at this time of the year to protect assets and not lose any money. Seasonal investing is designed to take advantage of trends such as this and improve performance versus the traditional buy-and-hold approach.
